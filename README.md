# map_app

A Flutter app for drawing different shapes on google maps like polygons, polylines, circles and squares, and also to add some custom icons or images on maps.

# Note
You have to use your own "google API key" for use, and also if you want to test this in the chrome you need to add this line in your index.html:
# <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY"></script>
